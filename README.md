# Color-palette-

Machine Learning Project Proposal

Topic

The topic of our research is “ Color Palette Generation for Outfit Coordination”. We want to
develop a generator that will see the clothes worn by person and generate the colors in that clothe.
What to do with the colors? We think this is the main part of all fashion themed projects made with
Machine Learning. Because, in order to do something with that clothes like recommendation or
fashion design, first step is always to generate the colors exist on the clothes.
